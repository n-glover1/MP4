Welcome to Pokagon Park, home to a variety of fun trails and activities. This is the first step to your interactive exploration of our wonderful park. You advance to the gatehouse. Normally, there is an attendant in here, however, since this is an online tour, you may forgo the 5 dollar parking fee and continue on your adventure :) Head to check out the Potawami Inn and pick up a map. You acquire a Parking Receipt from the Gatehouse. If you bring this to the Inn you may get a special prize.
